# CS495
## Lab Inventory Project

### Setup
1. Clone the repository-> Open a terminal and run the command:
   
   **git clone https://github.com/adamw1221/CS495-Lab-Inventory-Group-F.git**
   
2. Navigate into the project folder: **CD CS495-Lab-Inventory-Group-F**
3. All of the following commands will be run from this folder
4. The clone will be of the **main** branch, so if there's a more up to date branch like **sprint3** you can use this command:

   **git checkout -b <newBranchName> origin/<newBranchName**
   
6. Now you should be on the branch you just made, code form the up to date branch.

### Errors
If the run commands in the next section give you node_module errors, this should fix it:
- **rm -rf node_modules**
- **npm install**
  
### Run:
1. A) Run the command  **npm start**  to start our server and connect to our database.
   
   
   B) Or run **node js\server_side\server.js**


3. In your web browser paste and go to: **http://localhost:3000**
  
5. You should be directed to a login page.
   For access to all pages -> **username: admin**
   
   The password can be anything at the moment.
   
   Use any username other than admin for the student view.


## Project Focus
Our job is to build a web application to help the Robotics Lab manage inventory​

The web app will allow users to add, update, remove, and read lab equipment. It will also allow users to check out this equipment and notify users when it is due back.​
